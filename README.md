# BrowserOS
 
BrowserOS is designed to work largely in the browser.
It is based on Javascript.
At the moment there is no official backend, so you have to use Python.

## Install

- Download the repository.
- Generate SSL-Certificates or deactivate ssl in ```__main__.py```

## Test

```python .```
or
```python3 .```

Use your browser to access the application via one of the ports 80 or 443 of your IP.
You can also find the URL in the Python shell log.
