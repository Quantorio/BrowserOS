# Contributing

Everything from creating a bug report to a pull request: any add is
appreciated and welcome. If you have ideas for new features, please create
an issue first. This way we as a community can usefully link this and/or
you can join a group implementing this.

**If you have found any problems or bugs or have a suggestion, please use an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Quantorio/BrowserOS/issues/new).**
